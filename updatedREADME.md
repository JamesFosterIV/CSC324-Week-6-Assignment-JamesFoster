## Modified To-DO List Application
### -3/03/2025

## Overview
This is a modification of Professor Randleman's To-Do List Application. 
I have implemented the ability to complete tasks. 

## Features Implemented

- A new user choice to view Completed Tasks.
- **viewCompletedTask()**: This prints out the arrayList containing completed tasks.
- **completeTask()**: This removes the specified task from the ongoing task list and add it to the completed task list.


## Usage Examples

### View Completed Tasks

- There is now an option to view Completed or Ongoing Tasks

--- To-Do List ---
1. Add Task
2. View Ongoing Tasks
3. View Completed Tasks
4. Remove Task
5. Exit


- If the user tries to view completed tasks but there are no task completed, it says so and encourages you to get to work.
 
--- To-Do List ---
1. Add Task
2. View Ongoing Tasks
3. View Completed Tasks
4. Remove Task
5. Exit

Enter choice: 3

You haven't completed any Tasks! GET TO WORK!!!

- If the user has completed a task, then it displays the list of completed tasks.

--- To-Do List ---
